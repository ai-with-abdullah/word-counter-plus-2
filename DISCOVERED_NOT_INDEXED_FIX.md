# Google Search Console: "Discovered - Currently Not Indexed" Issue - FIXED

## Issue Summary

Your website has **22 pages** with the "Discovered - currently not indexed" status in Google Search Console. This means Google knows these pages exist but hasn't crawled or indexed them yet, preventing them from appearing in search results.

**Affected Pages:**
- Blog posts (15+ pages): ATS-optimized resume guide, manuscript formatting, brainstorming techniques, SEO publishing guide, cover letter optimization, and more
- Tool pages (7 pages): plagiarism-checker, random-word-generator, resume-cv-checker, seo-content-analyzer, text-case-converter, word-frequency-counter, words-per-page

## What Causes "Discovered - Currently Not Indexed"?

According to Google and SEO experts, this issue occurs when:

1. **Low Internal Linking** - Pages lack sufficient links from other pages on your site
2. **Crawl Budget Limitations** - Google's crawler can't reach all pages in time
3. **Low Page Authority** - Google doesn't prioritize crawling these pages
4. **Missing Structured Data** - Search engines can't understand page content properly
5. **Poor Site Architecture** - Pages are too deep in the site hierarchy

## Manual Steps You MUST Take (Required) ðŸ”´

These steps require you to take action in Google Search Console:

### Step 1: Request Indexing for Priority Pages (Do This First)

1. Go to Google Search Console â†’ URL Inspection tool
2. Enter the URL of each affected page (start with your most important ones)
3. Click **"Request Indexing"** button
4. **Important:** Only request indexing ONCE per URL - don't spam the button

**Priority pages to request first:**
- `/seo-content-analyzer`
- `/plagiarism-checker`
- `/resume-cv-checker`
- `/blog/seo-content-analysis-ranking-guide`
- `/blog/plagiarism-detection-academic-guide`
- `/blog/ats-optimized-resume-complete-guide`

**Pro tip:** Request 5-10 URLs per day to avoid being flagged as spam.

### Step 2: Submit Updated Sitemap

1. Go to Google Search Console â†’ Sitemaps
2. Remove old sitemap if exists
3. Add new sitemap: `https://wordcounterplusapp.com/sitemap.xml`
4. Click **"Submit"**
5. Wait 24-48 hours for Google to process it

Your sitemap is automatically generated and includes all blog posts and tool pages.

### Step 3: Monitor Progress

1. Go to Google Search Console â†’ Page indexing report
2. Check the "Discovered - currently not indexed" count weekly
3. You should see the number decrease over 2-4 weeks
4. Once pages move to "Indexed" status, they'll appear in search results

## Additional Recommendations (Optional but Helpful) ðŸŸ¡

### 1. Build External Backlinks
- Share your blog posts on social media (Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook)
- Submit articles to content aggregators (Medium, Dev.to, Hashnode)

- **Impact:** External links signal authority and speed up indexing

### 2. Regularly Update Content
- Update blog posts with fresh information every 3-6 months
- Add new sections, examples, or resources
- Update publish dates in the blogData.ts file
- **Impact:** Google prioritizes recently updated, evergreen content

### 3. Improve Page Load Speed
- Your site already uses optimized images
- Consider enabling browser caching for production
- Monitor Core Web Vitals in Google Search Console
- **Impact:** Faster sites get crawled more frequently

### 4. Add Internal Links in Existing Content
- Edit existing blog posts to link to newer blog posts
- Add "You might also like" sections
- Link tool pages to relevant blog posts
- **Impact:** Creates a web of interconnected content

## Timeline: When Will Pages Get Indexed?

Based on industry standards and Google's behavior:

- **Week 1-2:** Google discovers the improvements and starts re-crawling
- **Week 2-4:** Pages begin moving from "Discovered" to "Indexed" status
- **Week 4-8:** Most pages should be indexed if they meet quality standards
- **Ongoing:** New pages get indexed faster due to improved site structure

**Note:** Some pages may still not get indexed if Google determines they have thin content or duplicate information. Focus on your highest-quality, most unique pages first.

## How to Check if It's Working

### In Google Search Console:

1. **Page Indexing Report:**
   - Watch the "Discovered - currently not indexed" count decrease
   - Check "Indexed, not submitted in sitemap" count increase
   - Monitor "Crawled - currently not indexed" (should stay low)

2. **URL Inspection Tool:**
   - Test individual URLs to see their indexing status
   - Look for "URL is on Google" (success!) or "URL is not on Google"
   - Check "Last crawl" date to see recent activity

3. **Sitemap Report:**
   - Verify "Discovered" count matches your sitemap URLs
   - Check for any errors in sitemap processing

### On Your Website:

1. **Site Search:**
   - Search Google for: `site:wordcounterplusapp.com [page title]`
   - If the page appears, it's indexed!
   - Example: `site:wordcounterplusapp.com plagiarism checker`
